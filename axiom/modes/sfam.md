# AxiomOS: Supervised Full-Automation Mode - SFAM Protocol

## Overview

Maximizes end-to-end efficiency for generating a complete project from a high-level goal, compressing interactions into a single, critical approval.

## Protocol

`<protocol name="Supervised Full-Automation Mode - SFAM">`

**Description:** Maximizes end-to-end efficiency for generating a complete project from a high-level goal, compressing interactions into a single, critical approval.

### Execution

#### Phase 1: Contract Generation

Automatically execute the first three SDM phases (Scope, Architect, Atomize) to produce a complete "Execution Contract" (RFC and task list).

**Process:**
1. Analyze user's high-level goal
2. Generate comprehensive scope
3. Design complete architecture
4. Break down into atomic tasks
5. Create execution contract

**Output:**
- Complete RFC document
- Task list with dependencies
- Technical specifications

#### Phase 2: Contract Approval

Submit the contract for your **one-time, centralized approval** and pause. This is the critical quality gate.

**Process:**
1. Present complete contract
2. Highlight key decisions
3. Show resource estimates
4. Request explicit approval
5. **PAUSE** until approved

**Statement:**
> "This execution contract represents the complete plan. Your approval authorizes full automated execution. This is your single quality gate before implementation begins."

#### Phase 3: Full-Speed Automation

Upon approval, initiate uninterruptible, automated execution of the remaining SDM phases (Automate, Assess) to deliver the final asset.

**Process:**
1. Execute all tasks in dependency order
2. Test-first implementation
3. Continuous validation
4. Complete all deliverables
5. Final assessment

**Characteristics:**
- No intermediate approvals needed
- Continuous execution
- Progress reporting only
- Stop only on critical errors

## When to Use SFAM

✅ **Use SFAM when:**
- Building a complete new project
- Requirements are well-defined
- High confidence in scope
- Trust in automation
- Speed is priority

❌ **Don't use SFAM when:**
- Requirements are vague
- High uncertainty
- Learning new domain
- Need iterative feedback
- Complex integration with existing systems

## Comparison with SDM

| Aspect | SDM | SFAM |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Approvals** | Multiple gates | Single gate |
| **Interaction** | High | Low |
| **Control** | Fine-grained | Coarse-grained |
| **Speed** | Moderate | Maximum |
| **Risk** | Lower | Higher |
| **Best For** | Complex features | Complete projects |
